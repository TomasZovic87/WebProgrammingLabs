            <p>One of my favourite things to do is watch my favourite soccer team play, which is HNK Rijeka, from Croatia</p>

            <p>Another one of my hobbies is reading books, and I would say that my favourite series is Star Wars</p>
            <p>Out of the hundreds of books that are available in Star Wars canon and expanded universe, my favourite is Death Troopers, which is a horror novel.</p>

            <p>Along with enjoying reading the Star Wars books, there has been a lot of great movies and media to come out</p>
            <p>Linked below is one of my favourite pieces of Star Wars media which is a collection of advertisements from a video game released over 10 years ago</p>
